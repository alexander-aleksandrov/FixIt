# Wrong Keyboard Layout Fixing App

If you've ever been in a situation where you started typing in the wrong language and had to delete everything and start over, you know how frustrating and time-consuming it can be. That's why I was thrilled to create my own text replacement app. It automatically detects the language I'm typing in and replaces wrong text if I'm using the wrong layout. With a simple double-click of the Shift key, I can switch between different keyboard layouts, saving me time.

This is a Windows Forms application that runs in the system tray and helps to change already typed text to the correct keyboard layout. It also switches between different keyboard layouts on the fly. If the user is typing in the wrong language, the app replaces wrong text after pressing the Shift key as a double click.

## Getting Started

To use this app, you need to download and install it on your Windows computer. Once installed, the app will run in the background and monitor your keyboard input. Right now, keyboard layouts are hardcoded, but you can change them to fit your needs.

To change the keyboard layout, simply double-click the Shift key. This will switch between RU, UA, and US layouts in order UA > RU > US > RU in a cycle.

## Features

- Keyboard layout switcher: You can switch between different keyboard layouts by double-clicking the Shift key.
- System tray icon: The app runs in the background and displays a system tray icon for easy access.
- Lightweight and easy to use: This app is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface.

## Similar Apps

This app is similar to other popular language switcher apps, such as Caramba Switcher and Punto Switcher. However, this app is more lightweight and easier to use, with a simpler interface and fewer features.
