#Language Switcher App
This is a Windows Forms application that runs in the system tray and helps users to switch between different keyboard layouts on the fly. If the user is typing in a wrong language, the app can automatically detect this and suggest a correction by pressing the Shift key twice.

##Getting Started
To use this app, you need to download and install it on your Windows computer. Once installed, the app will run in the background and monitor your keyboard input. If you start typing in a language that is different from your current keyboard layout, the app will display a notification in the system tray, suggesting a correction.

To change the keyboard layout, simply double-click the Shift key. This will switch between the available layouts, based on the order they appear in the Windows settings.

##Features
Automatic language detection: The app can detect the language you are typing in and suggest a correction if you are using the wrong layout.
Keyboard layout switcher: You can switch between different keyboard layouts by double-clicking the Shift key.
System tray icon: The app runs in the background and displays a system tray icon for easy access.

###Similar Apps
This app is similar to other popular language switcher apps, such as Caramba Switcher and Punto Switcher. However, this app is more lightweight and easier to use, with a simpler interface and fewer features.
