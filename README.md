# Wrong Keyboard Layout Fixing App

If you've ever been in a situation where you started typing in the wrong language and had to delete everything and start over, you know how frustrating and time-consuming it can be. That's why I was thrilled to create my own text replacing and mapping app for learning programming goal. It automatically detects the language I'm typing in and if I'm using the wrong layout, with a simple double-click of the Shift key, I can replace already tiped with new one on another keyboard layout.

This is a Windows Forms application that runs in the system tray and helps to change already typed text to the correct keyboard layout. It also switches between different keyboard layouts on the fly. If the user is typing in the wrong language, the app replaces wrong text after pressing the Shift key as a double click.
